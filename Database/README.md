# New SDK-style SQL project with Microsoft.Build.Sql

## Setup

This project was created from scratch using the SQL Database Project template. To install the template (a one-time step), run the following command:

```bash
dotnet new install Microsoft.Build.Sql.Templates
```

Now, all you need to do is use the `sqlproj` template, as in this example:

```bash
dotnet new sqlproj -o Database -n DbMixed
```

## Build

To build the project, run the following command:

```bash
dotnet build
```

ðŸŽ‰ Congrats! You have successfully built the project and now have a `dacpac` to deploy anywhere.

## Publish

To publish the project, the SqlPackage CLI or the SQL Database Projects extension for Azure Data Studio/VS Code is required. The following command will publish the project to a local SQL Server instance:

```bash
./SqlPackage /Action:Publish /SourceFile:bin/Debug/DbMixed.dacpac /TargetServerName:localhost /TargetDatabaseName:DbMixed
```

### Install SqlPackage CLI

If you would like to use the command-line utility SqlPackage.exe for deploying the `dacpac`, you can obtain it as a dotnet tool.  The tool is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

```bash
dotnet tool install -g microsoft.sqlpackage
```
